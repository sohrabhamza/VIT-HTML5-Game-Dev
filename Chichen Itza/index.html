        <h2>What is Chichen Itza</h2>
        <p>Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The
            archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.

            Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600-900)
            through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800-900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD
            900-1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central
            Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican
            styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central
            Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the
            result
            of cultural diffusion.</p>
        <h2>Name and orthography</h2>
        <p>The Maya name "Chichen Itza" means "At the mouth of the well of the Itza." This derives from chi', meaning
            "mouth" or "edge", and chʼen or chʼeʼen, meaning "well". Itzá is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that
            gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is
            "enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,"[5] from its (itz), "sorcerer", and ha, "water".</p>
