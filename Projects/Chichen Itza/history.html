        <p>The layout of Chichen Itza site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900
            AD. Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a
            regional capital controlling the area from central Yucat√°n to the north coast, with its power extending down
            the east and west coasts of the peninsula. The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is
            equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.</p>
        <h2>Establisment</h2>
        <p>The Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main
            architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal
            platform upon which they were built.</p>
